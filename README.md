# FLOOD-IT GAME

This is an old assignment from my 1st year in Computer Science. I added a few fixes that I couldn't implement due to time constraints.

This is a simple program that utilises the flood-fill algorithm in a game called "flood-it".

# To start the game

1. The game runs on Ruby, so make sure to have Ruby installed on your machine.
    Link to Ruby downloads (follow install instructions based on OS): https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/

2. On the command prompt, input the following at the directory of the game:
    ```
    ruby floodit.rb
    ```

# Gameplay

The objective of the game is to fill the whole board with the same colour. You'll start off with the top left block of the board and you have to key in the colour to change the colour of the block to match the same colour with its neighbours.

Here are the inputs with their corresponding colours:-

| Input | Colours |
|-------|---------|
|   r   | red     |
|   y   | yellow  |
|   c   | cyan    |
|   b   | blue    |
|   m   | magenta |
|   g   | green   |

To stop mid-game, simply enter "q".
